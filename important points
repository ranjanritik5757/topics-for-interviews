what is stl : STL stands for standard template library which contains a lot of pre-defined templates in terms of containers and classes which makes it very easy for developers or programmers to implement different data structures easily without having to write complete code and worry about space-time complexities.



Collisions in an unordered_map occur when two different keys produce the same hash value 
Performance can degrade to O(n) if too many elements hash to the same value



min heap : priority_queue<int,vector<int>,greater<int>> minHeap


gcd(a,b) = gcd(a-b,b) which is also equivalent to gcd(a%b,b) (Eucilodian algorithm)
TC : O(log(min(a,b));


Finding all divisors 
We can optimise the previous approach by using the property that for any non-negative integer n, if d is a divisor of n then n/d is also a divisor of n.
This property is symmetric about the square root of n by traversing just the first half we can avoid redundant iteration and computations improving the efficiency of the algorithm.


A prime number is a number that is only divisible by 1 and itself and the total number of divisors is 2.
finding out whether a number is prime or not optimally is of O(sqrt(n))
